// Doubly linked lists are almost identical to singly linked lists,
// except that every node has another pointer, to the previous node.
// Each node in a doubly linked list points to the next node and 
// also the previous node. Unlink singly linked lists that only point to the next node

// compared to a singly linked list, a doubly linked list has more flexibility
// but it uses more memory because we are storing a previous and a next instead of just a next

// Each node will have a value, a next, and a previous
// The doubly linked list will have a head, tail, and length
