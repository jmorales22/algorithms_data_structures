//What do they do?
//Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them,
//and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

//Why are there so many data structures?
//Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized
//while others (like arrays or objects) are more generally used.

//Why care?
//The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to 
//use one of these data structures
//You've already worked with many of them unknowingly (the DOM)
//Interviews!!

//There is no one BEST data structure. They each excel in different situations

//ES2015 Syntax that you need to know for data structures - Class syntax

//What is a class?
//A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods
