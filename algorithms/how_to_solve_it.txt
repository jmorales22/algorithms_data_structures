WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?
A procss or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM (Strategies adapted from the book
by George Polya - How to Solve It)

1) Can I restate the problem in my own words?

2) What are the inputs that go into the problem?

3) What are the outputs that should come from 
   the solution to the problem?

4) Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In 
   other words, do you have enough information to solve 
   the problem? (Yyou may not have enough info to answer 
   this question until you set about solving the problem).

5) How should I label the important pieces of data that are 
   part of the problem?

NOTES FOR PROBLEM SOLVING:

- explicitly write down the steps you need to take
- write some psuedo code
- start with simple examples
- progress to more complex examples
- edge cases - explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs
- solve/simplify
- look back and refactor
